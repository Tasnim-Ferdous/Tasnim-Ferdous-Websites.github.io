        <h3 id="hb">History of Bangladesh</h3>

        <p>
        Modern Bangladesh emerged as an independent nation in 1971 after breaking away and achieving independence from <strong>Pakistan</strong> in the <strong>Bangladesh Liberation War</strong>. The country's borders corresponded with the major portion of the ancient and historic region of Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, where civilization dates back over four millennia, to the Chalcolithic. The history of the region is closely intertwined with the <strong>history of Bengal</strong> and the <strong>broader history of the Indian subcontinent</strong>.

        <h3 id="pp">Preview of Pala Dynasty</h3>

        <p>
        The <strong>Pala dynasty</strong> ruled Bengal until the middle of the twelfth century and expanded Bengali power to its farthest extent and supported Buddhism. It was the <strong>first independent Buddhist dynasty of Bengal</strong>. The name Pala (Bengali: পাল pal) means protector and was used as an ending to the names of all Pala monarchs. The Palas were followers of the <strong>Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism</strong>. <strong>Gopala</strong> was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to power in 750 in <strong>Gaur</strong>, after being elected by a group of <strong>feudal chiefs</strong>. He reigned from 750 to 770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of Bengal. He was succeeded by <strong>Dharmapala</strong>. The Palas promoted Buddhism and opposed Brahmanism. They provided support to Buddhist universities in <strong>Vikramashila</strong> and <strong>Nalanda</strong>. During the Pala dynasty the <strong>Vajrayana</strong> was developed in Bengal and introduced to Tibet. The Palas patronised the arts.
        </p>

        <p>
        The empire reached its peak under <strong>Dharmapala</strong> and <strong>Devapala</strong>. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent. This triggered once more for the control of the subcontinent. Devapala, successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire considerably. The Pala inscriptions credit him with extensive conquests in <strong>hyperbolic language</strong>. <strong>The Badal pillar</strong> inscription of his successor Narayana Pala states that he became the suzerain monarch or <strong>Chakravarti</strong> of the whole tract of Northern India bounded by the Vindhyas and the Himalayas. It also states that his empire extended up to the two oceans (presumably the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal). It also claims that Devpala defeated Utkala (present-day Orissa), the Hunas, the Dravidas, the Kamarupa (present-day Assam), the Kambojas and the Gurjaras. <strong>Historian B. P. Sinha wrote that these claims about Devapala's victories are exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed entirely.</strong> Besides, the neighbouring kingdoms of Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, which might have helped him extend his empire. Devapala is also believed to have led an army up to the Indus river in Punjab. Devapala shifted the capital from <strong>Monghyr to Pataliputra</strong>. Although they were Bengali the dynasty considered the Ganges valley as the centre of its power.
        </p>

        <p>
        The dynasty's power declined after Devapala's death. During the rule of Mahipala I the South Indian <strong>Chola dynasty</strong> challenged the Palas. During the later part of Pala rule, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire frequently invaded Bengal from 1021 to 1023 to get Ganges water and in the process, succeeded in humbling the rulers and acquiring considerable booty. <strong>The rulers of Bengal who were defeated by Rajendra Chola were Dharmapal, Ranasur and Govindachandra of the Candra Dynasty who might have been feudatories under Mahipala of the Pala Dynasty.</strong> The invasion by the south Indian ruler Vikramaditya VI of the Western Chalukya Empire brought his countrymen from Karnataka into Bengal which explains the southern origin of the Sena Dynasty. Around the 1150s the Palas lost power to the Senas.

        <p>
        Most of the Pala inscriptions mention only the regnal year as the date of issue, without any well-known calendar era. Because of this, the chronology of the Pala kings is hard to determine. Based on their different interpretations of the various epigraphs and historical records, different historians estimate the Pala chronology as follows:

        Gopala (ruled c. 750s–770s CE) was the founder of the Pala Dynasty of Bengal region of the Indian Subcontinent. The last morpheme of his name Pala means "protector" and was used as an ending for the names of all the Pala monarchs. Pala does not suggest or indicate any ethnic or caste considerations of the Pala dynasty. He came to power around 750 CE in <strong>Gaur / Gwal</strong> after being elected by a group of regional chieftains.

        Dharmapala (ruled 8th century) was the second ruler of the Pala Empire of Bengal region in the Indian Subcontinent. He was the son and successor of Gopala, the founder of the Pala Dynasty. He greatly expanded the boundaries of the empire, and made the Palas a dominant power in the northern and eastern India.<br>
        Dharmapala directly ruled over the present-day Bengal and Bihar, and installed a nominee at Kannauj. The Pala chronicles also claim that several other rulers of North India acknowledged his suzerainty, but these claims seem to be exaggerated. Dharmapala was defeated twice by the Gurjara-Pratiharas, but each time the Rashtrakutas subsequently defeated the Pratiharas, leaving Palas as the dominant power in North India. Dharmapala was succeeded by his son Devapala who further expanded the empire.

        Devapala (9th century) was the <strong>most powerful ruler</strong> of the Pala Empire of Bengal region in the Indian Subcontinent. He was the third king in the line, and had succeeded his father Dharamapala. Devapala expanded the frontiers of the empire by conquering the present-day Assam and Orissa. The Pala inscriptions also credit him with several other victories, but these claims are thought to be exaggerated.

        Mahendrapala (r. c. 854-860) was the fourth king of the Pala dynasty of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. He was the son of Devapala and his queen Mahata.<br>
        Mahendrapala has been mentioned in some Pala records, but earlier, <strong>the historians used to believe that these mentions referred to the Gurjara-Pratihara king Mahendrapala I.</strong> However, the discovery of the Jagjivanpur copper plate charter issued by Mahendrapala made it clear that he was a distinct Pala emperor, who succeeded Devapala. The charter, issued in the 7th year of Mahendrapala's reign (believed to be 854 CE), mentions the construction of a monastery at Nandadirghika Udranga by Mahendrapala's mahasenapati ("great general") Vajradeva. The grant is dated in his 7th regnal year and issued from the Kuddalakhataka jayaskandhavara (the camp of victory).<br>
        Mahendrapala was succeeded by Shurapala I. According to the Jagjivanpur inscription, Shurapala I was Mahendrapala's younger brother and royal envoy. Mahendrapala appears to have retained the Pala control over Bengal and Bihar.

        Shurapala I (also spelt Surapala) was a 9th-century ruler of the Pala Empire, in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent.<br>
        <strong>Previously, the historians believed that Shurapala and Vigrahapala were the two names of the same person. However, the discovery of a copper plate in 1970 in the Mirzapur district conclusively established that these two were cousins.</strong> They either ruled simultaneously (perhaps over different territories) or in rapid succession. If they ruled in succession, it seems more likely that Shurapala preceded Vigrahapala, since Vigrahapala I and his descendants ruled in unbroken succession. <strong>Vigrahapala either dethroned Shurapala, or replaced him peacefully in absence of any direct heir to the throne.</strong><br>
        Earlier, it was believed that Shurapala and Vigrahapala succeeded Devapala. However, the discovery of a copper plate charter at Jagjivanpur indicates that Shurapala was preceded by Mahendrapala. Both were sons of Devapala and his queen Mahata. <strong>According to the Jagjivanpur inscription Shurapala I was Mahendrapala's younger brother and royal envoy.</strong>

        Mahipala (or Mahipala I; r. 988–1038) was a notable king of the Pala dynasty, which ruled over much of the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent between the 8th and 12th centuries. He was the son and successor of Vigrahapala II. Mahipala's reign marked a resurgence in fortunes for the Pala empire, whose boundaries were expanded as far as Varanasi. However, his rule was temporarily hampered by the northern expedition of the Chola king, Rajendra I.<br>

        Vigrahapala III (1055 – 1070 CE) was the successor to the Pala king Nayapala in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, and twelfth ruler of the Pala line reigning for 15 years. He was succeeded by Mahipala II.<br>
        During the reign of Vigrahapala III, the Kalachuri king Karna once again invaded Bengal but was defeated. The conflict ended with a peace treaty, and Vigrahapala III married Karna's daughter Yauvanasri. Vigrahapala III was later defeated by the invading Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI. The invasion of Vikramaditya VI saw several soldiers from South India into Bengal, which explains the southern origin of the Sena Dynasty. Vigrahapala III also faced another invasion led by the Somavamsi king Mahasivagupta Yayati of Orissa. Subsequently, a series of invasions considerably reduced the power of the Palas. The Varmans occupied eastern Bengal during his reign. The emergent Sena dynasty seized Radha from the Palas, beginning the decline of their power in the region.<br>
        He was succeeded in quick succession by his three sons, starting with Mahipala II in 1070.

        Ramapala (reigned 1082–1124 AD) was the successor to the Pala king Shurapala II in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, and fifteenth ruler of the Pala line.<br>
        Rampala is recognised as the last great ruler of the dynasty, managing to restore much of the past glory of the Pala lineage. He crushed the Varendra Rebellion and extended his empire farther to Kamarupa, Orissa and Northern India. He was succeeded by Kumarapala. According to Bengali legend he died by walking into the sea. Sandhyakar Nandi, the court poet of Ramapala wrote a Sanskrit two meaning base poem-like novel Ramacharitam.<br>
        After gaining control of Varendra, Ramapala tried to revive the Pala empire with limited success. He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty's end. <strong>He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought Kamarupa and Rar under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty.</strong> He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annex the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas. He kept the Sens in check, but lost Mithila to a Karnataka chief named Nanyuadeva. He also held back the aggressive design of the Gahadavala ruler Govindachandra through a matrimonial alliance.<br>
        A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita now in LACM. was copied in the Kurkihar monastery during the rule of Ramapala.

        Kumarapala was the successor to the Pala king Ramapala in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, and sixteenth ruler of the Pala line reigning for 10 years. During his reign he put down an uprising in Kamarupa by the governor Timgyadeva, eventually replacing him with Vaidyadeva (who would rebel four years after the death of Kumarapala). He was succeeded by Gopala III.

        Madanapala (reigned 1144 – 1162 CE) was the successor to the Pala king Gopala III in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, and eighteenth and final ruler of Pala lineage reigning for 18 years. He was succeeded by Govindapala, whose lineage of that name is questionable.<br>
        During his reign, the encroachment by the Sena dynasty eventually reduced the Pala domains to Bihar. In Harikela, the Varman dynasty were conquered by the Sena dynasty leaving the Palas as the only other significant power in Bengal.
